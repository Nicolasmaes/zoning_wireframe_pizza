Basil Margherita$11.80

size small v

Margherita pizza starts fresh basil, mozzarella, and the bas tomatoes you can find.  It's still a delicious, simple showcase of good quality produce, but the addition of crisp, chewy pizza crust, melty cheese, and warm sauce makes it a cozier, heartier meal.

Jalape単o
$14.50
medium

All the flavors of a cheesy jalape単o popper is so much better in pizza form, with added bacon of course ! Imagine a jalape単o popper in the form of a pizza. Yes, it's as epic as it sounds. And better than a traidtional jalape単o popper in my opinion.
